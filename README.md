# ironic
It's an emulator.

Specific to Linux platforms, no Windows/Mac compatibility planned.

## Contributing
I am not interested in accepting contributions to this project and I will
probably work on it alone.

## Building
I use Nightly by default, so you may have to do something like this:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hosaka-corp/ironic && cd ironic/
...
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ rustup override set nightly
```
